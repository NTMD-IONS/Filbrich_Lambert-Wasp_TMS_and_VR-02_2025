# Objective
I'm preparing an experiment that combines sensitization of nociceptive pathways, single-pulse TMS and presentation of visual stimuli in VR. I aim to test wether threatening visual stimuli that approach 
the sensitized limb have an impact on corticospinal excitability as measured with motor evoked potentials. I also plan to measure RT to the visual stimuli. 

# What CATL can do for you?
The virtual environment has been programmed by the collaborators from Argentina. I will mostly need help in setting up the VR equipement and make it compatible with the neuronavigation system in the TMS lab 
as well in verifying the timing of the triggers that are sent to the TMS and an electrical stimulation device. If an additional script to the one running in the VR application is needed I would also need help for that.
